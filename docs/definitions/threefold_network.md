The ThreeFold Network is the **Autonomous Internet – a decentralized, self-driving, & self-healing Internet** build by many, and made for you. The Threefold Network is an ecosystem composed of three main elements working together to form a truly decentralized marketplace for storage, compute, and applications.

**ThreeFold Grid:**<br/>
ThreeFold Grid is an alternative to centralized cloud providers – a global, neutral, and sustainable network of autonomous storage and compute Internet capacity created by ThreeFold Farmers, with more than 80,000 TB and 14,000 cores existing today. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the ThreeFold Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost.

**ThreeFold Token:**<br/>
ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized digital currency used to buy autonomous and decentralized Internet services (compute, storage, applications) on the ThreeFold Network – generated only when active capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

**3Bot:**<br/>
3Bot lives on top of the ThreeFold Grid and acts as your digital self. It is your personal all-in-one application, which gives back the ownership of your data to only you – and no one else. 3Bot is your escape from the many popular centralized and often-abused applications used by a big majority of the world today. Your digital self grants you full access to a 100% neutral and decentralized digital life.
