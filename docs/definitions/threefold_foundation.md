## ThreeFold Foundation (TFF)

The TF Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on democratizing internet compute and storage capacity to enable a responsible internet for all. Open source software empowers people to create neutral, green and private capacity across the globe that’s blockchain driven and 100% decentralized. 

Our mission at the ThreeFold Foundation (“TFF”) is to empower the internet of tomorrow by building a complimentary internet that is neutral, decentralized, and environmentally sustainable. Leveraging blockchain technology, an ecosystem of IT infrastructure brings community owned IT capacity online to match the exponential growth in demand (from IoT, Machine Learning, AI). By using a “hyper-distributed” network architecture that incentivizes "Farmers" to plug-in efficient computing and storage devices around the world to the ThreeFold Grid ("TF Grid"),  it enables digital service/application providers anywhere to host their applications closer to end users (also called edge computing). This model consumes up to 10 times less power, is independent of any government or corporation, and leads to significantly greater performance at a lower price point. 

To support the ecosystem, a digital currency is used to trade compute and storage capacity on the Grid.  The ThreeFold Token aims to be the most reliable & responsible digital currency. Each token is exclusively created by “green farming”, and is backed by real internet infrastructure.
"Farmers" earn tokens for maintaining their capacity online, in addition to the capacity they sell. This farmed capacity automatically enters the ThreeFold Grid, and it’s listed in a blockchain based directory showing available capacity.


All the ideas and content created for this concept are opensource and stored in this repository.
A group of volunteers and the ThreeFold Foundation maintain these repositories. Meet the team [here]( https://threefold.io/team/).
