## ThreeFold Farmer

TF Farmers are entrepreneurs who farm ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) by connecting hardware to the ThreeFold Grid.

As a result of Farming, internet capacity capacity is generated and available on the ThreeFold Grid Directory.

A Farmer earns tokens in 2 ways:
- Farming: as a result of connecting server hardware (IC generators) to the ThreeFold Grid

- Cultivation: as a result of their Farming Pool capacity being utilised (sold) by ThreeFold Grid Capacity users

There are three types of capacity farmers:
- Cooperative Farmers: purchase a range of services from a ThreeFold cooperative up to and including, ThreeFold certified hardware, installation and -if available- location, power and connectivity

- Individual Farmers: use ThreeFold certified hardware but complete their own installation, provide their own location, power and connectivity

- DIY Farmers: use their own choice of hardware (uncertified hardware)Farmers can cultivate both managed and/or unmanaged capacity.
