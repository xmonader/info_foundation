## ThreeFold Token (TFT)

ThreeFold Token (TFT) is a decentralized, neutral and secure digital currency backed by the fastest growing commodity in the world, the internet.

It has a specific commercial utility, since ThreeFold tokens were conceived as the designated currency for buying and selling capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.

ThreeFold Tokens are exclusively produced through a process called farming, which means that TFT are generated only when new internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. There was no ICO and there is no wasteful mining.

TFT are managed by the ThreeFold Blockchain (“TF Chain”). The TF Chain can issue a maximum of 100 billion tokens.
