# Circle Tools

## Aims of our tools

- Clarity, Tracability, Transparency and Active Teamwork.
  - Clarity: try to ensure that your communications are clear, understandable, well written and purposeful.
  - Tracability: we are a complex organisation attempting something amazing, it is important we can work out who contributed what and when so we can come back to them for clarification if needed!
  - Transparency: we are open communicators, we want to be brave enough to share the good, the bad and the ugly. To be honest with each other, without being unkind. To celebrate with each other whole-heartedly when we succeed.
  - Active Teamwork: every tool is there for us to take focused action towards our common goals. Use them to help the team move forward towards completed work as efficiently and effectively as you can.

## Definition Of Circles

- Ensure all circles are defined on [our circles page](/circles/) IMPORTANT !!!

## Trello

- Each circle has an associated Trello team or is part of another team..
- The Trello team for each circle is linked from [our circles page](/circles/).
- To ensure we all have visibility of all projects, you should only create new boards within the Trello team.
- We should stick with the free version of Trello because we will have thousands of people participating in the future and we don't want to lock people out of functions because they don't have a subscription.

## Google Docs

- All non-wiki docs need to go to the correctly shared folder on Google Drive.
- Do not keep docs which will be shared with other people in your own drive.
   - Create the doc directly in the correct folder on the shared drive, this ensure that everyone who hs access to that folder can follow progress of all files in that folder.
- Edit directly in Google Docs. Do not import from other formats, or export and import. It is really hard to stop this introducing all kinds of awful formatting which can cause pain and wasted time later on.
- When creating presentations: use master slides & link them to the presentations used within the community.
- Use the comment feature (ctrl/cmd+alt+m) to collaborate with each other. If you use +username, it will automagically assign the comment to the person and email them.
- Everyone contributing more than couple of hours per month should have a gmail account in our organization on Google within our incubaid.com Gsuite domain.
   - Ask for an account on an appropriate domain name.
- Practice good file hygiene. Use ```_archive/_beta``` folders in each drive to organize docs, only ACTIVE content should be in the standard folders. 
   
## Mail

- Everyone contributing more than couple of hours per month should have a gmail account in our organization on Google within our incubaid.com Gsuite domain.
   - Ask for an account on an appropriate domain name.
   - Any cooperative or other organization that wants to be part of our domain, please contact us. This will make it easier to organize our commnunity.
- You can get email aliases on any of the organizations e.g. threefoldtoken, etc.

## Mattermost: chat

- Try to organize your conversations into well-ordered and understandable topics.
