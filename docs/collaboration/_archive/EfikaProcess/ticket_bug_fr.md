**The issues described below are only to be used in github or in [EE Content Repo's](https://docs.grid.tf/dividi/efika/src/branch/master/Efika_Agile/EfikaProcess/repositories.md#content-repos)**

Do not use them to plan work please, they are here to help the organization to prioritize and then stories/tasks are used to plan work.

## Types

### Ticket

A ticket is used to track what is going on with the issue as raised by the customer.

Tickets are dealt with by a support team or customer services team. They are the link between the community/customer and the rest of the organization.

* An issue gets normally raised by a customer or internal employee
* Escalates issues like downtime, performance degradation, question, ...
* Only used in [EE Content Repo's](https://docs.grid.tf/dividi/efika/src/branch/master/Efika_Agile/EfikaProcess/repositories.md#content-repos)

### Bug

* Issue of product
* Raised by support person or developer \(gig or external if opensource\)
* If customers see a bug they normally will create a ticket first and the support person will create a bug and follow up

#### Body for Bug:

* screenshots if relevant
* on which environment this was seen
* link to logs if any
* Never use a bug to plan work.

### Feature request \(FR\)

* This can be a feature for a product.
* This can be a feature for a project.

* define why this is important for you \(because you filed this FR\)
