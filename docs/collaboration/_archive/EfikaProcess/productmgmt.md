* Product owners need to be well defined, this gets documented in `org_development` repo

* Regular meetings are super important see [meetings](meetings.md)

* Communication

  * Call for meetings on telegram channel, when info worth sharing about product group also use this
  * Telegram: `$company_product_$shortnameOfProductGroup`
    * e.g. gig\_product\_ovc
    * e.g. gig\_product\_g8os
    * e.g. gig\_product\_js

## Product Management versus Product Owner

* Product Manager
  * is the middleman in the company
  * its like a project manager for a project but in this case for a set of products
  * owns relation towards sales/market
  * uses prod\_ ... repo's in EE
* Product Owner
  * Is a technical person who is part of engineering/development organization.
  * Makes sure that
    * roadmaps get implemented
      * milestones are properly set
    * repo's are properly managed
    * quality of the code is ok
  * uses coderepo's in EE
