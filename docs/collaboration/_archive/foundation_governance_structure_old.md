# How is the Foundation Governed?

## The Foundation’s Governance Objectives

Our goal is to keep the foundation:

- effective and agile with just enough freedom
- fully accountable and controllable (by means of a board)
- transparent just like a public institution and even more, giving real governance instruments to the community;

The governance framework must preserve and protect the Foundation’s mission [see foundation faq](http://www.threefoldtoken.com/faq/foundation)

In order to balance these two (sometimes competing) priorities - the Foundation adopted a governance structure consisting of three separate Boards of Directors and a strong management team of 3 company directors.

## Company Directors

- The company is legally run by 3 directors. These 3 people report into the Foundation Board.
- To allow the Foundation to stay flexible these directors can operate within the guidelines as approved by the Foundation Board. They also have to follow any budgets approved by the Foundation Board.
- This group of directors runs the company from a day to day basis and are paid by the Foundation for their services.
- Every month these directors need to report to the Foundation board.
- There are well defined lists of decisions for which these directors need approval from the Foundation Board.

The directors are tasked with running the Foundation day-to-day and they will organize work by means of values & principles as defined in this repository.  They manage the Foundation’s engineering efforts, ensuring that they are done according the the goals and in time. They also manage the Foundation’s marketing efforts and communication with public, prepare regular updates for the Foundation Board (and others) - and are in charge of submitting all required decision proposals (DPs or Decision Proposals) to one or more off the Boards when appropriate.



## 3 Boards

### The Foundation Board

The primary functions of the Foundation Board is to control & help the Company Directors.
Together they agree on the strategy of the Foundation and to enforce discipline and accountability of the management team. The Foundation Board is very active and acts in the role of a typical company Board of Directors - with monthly Board meetings and a long list of corporate duties and responsibilities, ranging from risk management to audit compliance.

The Foundation Board is comprised of 7 members. Three of the directors are the Foundation’s Directors who lead the management team.  The other four members are non-executive directors selected by the Ambassador Board (see below).

The Foundation Board has to agree on the strategy and management of the Foundation - except for certain important exceptions such as issuing additional Tokens and raising additional external financing where additional approvals from the Ambassador Board are required. There will be many more exceptions which still have to be defined.


### The Ambassador Board

The Ambassador Board is comprised of 50 to 100 members. 

The primary function of the Ambassador Board is to serve as a safeguard for the Foundation Board and to vote on certain Decision Proposals requiring Ambassador Board consent.

In particular the Ambassador Board can

- appoint the four non-executive directors of the Foundation Board.
- replace the Foundation Board members if needed (this requires a 60% Ambassador Board majority).
- also change the voting requirements / scope of Decision Proposals (75% majority required).
- accept a new member for the Ambassador board, accepts resignation of Ambassador board.

The Ambassador Board is less active than the Foundation Board - with only two scheduled mandatory meetings per year and ad hoc meetings requiring a minimum quorum if called by the Foundation Board.

### The Community Board

The Community Board consists out of Threefold Foundation members who want to help and give advise to the ambassador board.
We use these votes to give recommendations to the Ambassador Board

The primary function of the Community Board is to vote by simple majority on certain well-defined Decision Proposals (DP’s).

The Community Board receives regularly scheduled updates on the operations and performance of the Foundation.

The process for Community Board votes is blockchain-based and very straightforward.

- written Decision Proposals are prepared by the Company Directors and submitted to all Community Board members via the TF App at least one week prior to the vote.
- if necessary a Zoom presentation or recorded can also be scheduled (again - well in advance).
- voting then takes place over a prescribed 48 hour period (each token counts as 1 vote if used by the token holder, means if the token holder decided to vote within that period).

## Decision Proposals

- Decision Proposals (DP’s) are made by directors or Foundation board or Ambassador Board.
