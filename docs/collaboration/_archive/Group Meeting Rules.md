# Org 4.0 Group Meeting Guide


We are a team of bright individuals and thinkers. We are driven and opinionated. Together we are a power that can and will change the world. However, this very same power may get in the way of having an effective meeting.

Remote meetings are tricky, because they hinder our ability to recognize when our colleague is about to speak or “not finished”, it prevents us from getting on the “same wavelength” as easily as an in-person meeting. This is why we’ve devised a few agreements that every participant of the Foundation’s meetings agree to, whether they host or participate in a TFF meeting (for participant agreements, please scroll down).  

## Agreements for the meeting host: 

### Pre-Meeting
**Agenda:** Have specific agenda, share it with participants in advance. 

**Relevance:** Invite people relevant to your agenda only. When in doubt, please check with the Herald  (Roel) or the Guardian (George). 

**Schedule ahead:** we all have intense agendas and multiple time zones to juggle, please be mindful. * A nice touch: when you give the meeting time, expressed in your participants’ time zone, it kills two birds with one stone: 1) show your consideration; 2) ensure that they do not confuse the time, i.e. make sure your meeting happens. 

**Organize calendar:** Always send out a calendar invite to your group. 

### During Meeting
**Keep it structured:** When opening the meeting, please state the agenda and the results you are looking to achieve as a result of this meeting. It would help everyone focus on the end goals. 

**Host responsibility:** Sticking with agenda is YOUR responsibility. When somebody wanders off, gently remind them that “the topic they raise is very valuable, but is outside of the scope of agenda of today’s call”. 

**Be specific:** no meeting can be effective without milestones and deadlines. Assign specific tasks to specific individuals with concrete deadlines. Those with tasks (i.e. assignments) become assignees.  

**Take notes**: it is your responsibility as a meeting host to have a record of the meeting. If you are unable to take notes, please solicit a colleague to take notes for you. (recording your meeting and taking notes + spreading afterwards is always an option)

### Post-Meeting
**Enter tasks into GOGs:** The tasks (issues) must be entered into the GOGs within an hour of the meeting. 

**Communicate up:** The meeting notes should be shared with participants, with George and with the person in charge of the realm you’re working in (e.g. marketing with Roel, fundraising with Elena, ask George if in doubt) within an hour of the meeting. 


**Execution: **Support the assignees in their task completion. Ask them what support they need from you to effectively complete the task, check back in in the interim! Not the day of the deadline. 

**Follow up: **It is your responsibility as a meeting host to hold your nominees accountable for the tasks they commit to. Track in the GOGs and offline. Ensure the task is completed. 

## Agreements for the meeting participant: 
**Focus:** Please put aside your non-meeting related mobile devices for the duration of the meeting. 

**Follow the lead:** Please take cues from the meeting host on when is a good time to speak. If you notice that the meeting host is trying to cut you off - please comply. The meeting host is entrusted with the mission to make the most of everybody’s time, including yours. Rely on the meeting host to steer everybody and yourself in the right direction. 

**Stick to agenda:** If you have a brilliant idea, which is irrelevant to THIS meeting, please jot it down and share with the meeting host after the meeting. 

**Take notes:** Taking notes is proven to improve information retention. Take advantage! Taking notes would help you to cross check the tasks (issues) inputted in GOGs: the assignee, the date, the scope are correct (and that you understood everything correctly). 

**Be accountable:** If you volunteer to a task, please understand that you are now accountable for completion of this task. It is solely your responsibility to complete the task and inform the meeting host (and make sure that she informs the Guardian and respective person in charge). 

**Follow up:** Please check in with the meeting host, if that was all or if any items are pending.
