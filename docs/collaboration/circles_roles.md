### Each circle has different levels of contributors

- circle coordinator (coordinator of the circle, is not a boss) 
    - see also [head_of_mission_profile](head_of_mission_profile.md)
    - is also a circle stakeholder & member
    - Elephant+ level in [circular_collaboration_levels](circular_collaboration_levels.md), or has the ambition/capability to grow to that level.
- story coordinator
    - coordinator of one of more stories in the circle
    - is also a circle stakeholder & member
    - Wolf+ level in [circular_collaboration_levels](circular_collaboration_levels.md), or has the ambition/capability to grow/surpass that level.
- circle member
    - works on stories of the circle
    - is also a circle stakeholder
    - follows the scrum meetings
- circle collaborator (can ad hoc do something for the circle, only works on existing stories, is ad hoc work)
    - Pup+ level in [circular_collaboration_levels](circular_collaboration_levels.md) !
    - No need to follow scrum meetings, all can happend ad hoc, will probably work together with a circle member to contribute effectively.
- circle stakeholder (has something to loose or win by the output of the circle)
    - No need to follow scrum meetings
    - Can follow priorities and provide input
- circle follower (is following whatever happens in the circle)
    - We attempt to have circles very open, everyone can follow

#### remarks

there are max 10 circle members/coordinators per circle this to keep it efficient.
There can be many more followers & collaborators.

### levels of coordination

### Circle Coordinator

Coordinates (helps) a team of people working on one or more stories and ensures that:

* There is a circle home page with updated information (wiki part of circles tool)
* All members understand our Agile principles of working together
* All members find their way into our community & our tools & information
* All members are happy to contribute and are motivated/passionate
* Is able to eliminate the blockages that circle members might experience

Circle Coordinators are often also story owners \(of X nr of stories\)

A Circle Coordinator is not a controller! It's a person at service of his or her team. 

- Coordinators manage circles.
- A circle is a group of people working together around a set of specific topics.
- A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.

It's the reverse of an authoritative, or autocratic power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed. A coordinator makes sure others can easily contribute and they can find all the information they require, they discover and clear road-blocks and make it possible for people to be their best, its about getting the process to work smoothly without being in the way.

A coordinator:

- is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for
- makes sure that:
  - every contributor of the circle understands and follows the agile principles and becomes a good contributor
  - the mission or strategy of the circle is known & understood - documentation e.g. a wiki is ideal
  - the goals are translated into achieveable work and this happens by means of [stories](/collaboration/stories.md)
  - quality [stories](/collaboration/stories.md) are created (well explained, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)
  - stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress
  - story owner's (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep to time, have the resources they need, know the specific goal of the story, know who and how to escalate to, make use of comments to clearly track progress)
- is a teacher or coach
  - they get alongside people and help them be their best
  - they help people to become a better contributor
  - are able to explain why agile principles work so well within an organization like ours

My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good Circle Coordinator, its not an easy job.


### Story Coordinator

Main responsibilities:

* Story card is done in time
* Story card has clear deliverables and it's easy to  be understood 
* Requirements for the card are met
* Done means done!
* Communicate to stakeholders about the card
* Define tasks that need to be delivered to close the story card = checklist in story
* Story card respects the timelines on the kanban

### Stakeholder

* Anybody who has something to lose or win by the acceptance/progress on a story card
* Stakeholder main responsibility is to be part of the required story boards & be vocal about requirements
* This is a very generic definition & can be quite broad.
