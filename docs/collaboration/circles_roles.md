### Circle Coordinator

Coordinates (helps) a team of people working on one or more stories and ensures that:
* There is a circle home page with updated information
* All members understand our Agile principles of working together
* All members find their way into our community & our tools & information
* All members are happy to contribute and are motivated/passionate
* Is able to eliminate the blockages that circle members might experience

Circle Coordinators are often also story owners \(of X nr of stories\)

A Circle Coordinator is not a controller! It's a person at service of his or her team. A Scrum Master = a coach/coordinator.

A circle is a team on trello e.g. https://trello.com/tf_foundation/members

### Board Owner

Owner for a specific (Trello) board e.g. https://trello.com/b/LRPeXGUl/tffundroadmapweb

A board owner does not own people, its a person who coordinates around a board.

There are multiple types of boards see [trello_usage](trello_usage.md)

There is only one board owner per repo

Responsibilities:

  * Make sure trello card follows the right structure
  * Make sure all information in relation to the board is properly structured, easy to understand
  * Verify / check all stories \(guarantees quality, priorities, communication around it, ...\)
  * Work with stakeholders to make sure you get the features as required.
  * Organize stakeholder meetings when necessary (to get feedback)
  


### Story owner

Main responsibilities:

* Story card is done in time
* Story card has clear deliverables and it's easy to  be understood 
* Requirements for the card are met
* Done means done!
* Communicate to stakeholders about the card
* Define tasks that need to be delivered to close the story card = checklist in story

### Product Owner

Responsible for a product e.g. jumpscale

Uses the home repo to define the structure in the account

* Important to structure the accounts on Github well so they represent a product
* There can be more than 1 owner per repo, but try to only have 1.
* The home repo is important to organize the full account/organization.

Responsibilities

  * Define milestones = versions on the repo's, make sure they are consistent
  * Make sure the repos in the account/organization are clean
  * Make sure everyone using the repo's behave well
    * proper defined bugs/fr
    * proper branching
  * Work with Project/Product Managers & other stakeholders to make sure the repo structure is ok.



### Stakeholder

* Anybody who has something to lose or win by the acceptance/progress on a story card
* Stakeholder main responsibility is to be part of the required story boards & be vocal about requirements
* This is a very generic definition & can be quite broad.
