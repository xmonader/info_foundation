### Circle Coordinator

Coordinates (helps) a team of people working on one or more stories and ensures that:

* There is a circle home page with updated information (wiki part of circles tool)
* All members understand our Agile principles of working together
* All members find their way into our community & our tools & information
* All members are happy to contribute and are motivated/passionate
* Is able to eliminate the blockages that circle members might experience

Circle Coordinators are often also story owners \(of X nr of stories\)

A Circle Coordinator is not a controller! It's a person at service of his or her team. A Scrum Master = a coach/coordinator.

Example of a circle: [https://circles.threefold.me/project/sacha96-threefold-marketing/kanban](https://circles.threefold.me/project/sacha96-threefold-marketing/kanban)


### Story owner

Main responsibilities:

* Story card is done in time
* Story card has clear deliverables and it's easy to  be understood 
* Requirements for the card are met
* Done means done!
* Communicate to stakeholders about the card
* Define tasks that need to be delivered to close the story card = checklist in story
* Story card respects the timelines on the kanban

### Stakeholder

* Anybody who has something to lose or win by the acceptance/progress on a story card
* Stakeholder main responsibility is to be part of the required story boards & be vocal about requirements
* This is a very generic definition & can be quite broad.
