## Visualize over multiple projects in our Extranet (only relevant for product related repo's)

### How to use the Kanban tool

Kanban present the issues and pull requests from one or more EE repository

We use 5 columns to categorize our works:

![](images/kanban.png)

- Kanban can visualize stories, tasks, bugs/feature requests
- Kanban's are attached to milestone projects
- The same Kanban Kanban can visualize all mentioned categories above, use filters to select
- Kanban also allows a user to see which tasks/stories are assigned to him over multiple repo's
- For each Kanban linked to milestone we also link all relevant code repositories so we can use the same Kanban to see progress on STORIES, TASKS...


#### Stories

- **NEW** or **BACKLOG**:: Stories selected for milestone but no work started yet
- **INPROGRESS**: Stories which are being worked on
- **QUESTION**: Stories which need feedback and need to be discussed
- **VERIFICATION**: When a story is done, the next step is to review it; this is a vey important step in our process
- **DONE**: After review the story is DONE, can be released if relevant.


#### Tasks

- **NEW**: Tasks not started yet
- **INPROGRESS**: When someone is working on a task, the task is known as in progress. By looking at that column we can track on what the team is focusing on at the moment
- **QUESTION**: Task is unclear it needs attention
- **VERIFICATION**: optional, sometimes a task needs to be validated
- **DONE**: Done


#### Bugs and feature requests

- **NEW**: Unsorted bugs/fr
- **INPROGRESS**: Active people are working on it
