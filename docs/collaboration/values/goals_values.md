## fear versus love

Everything can be brought back to fear & love.

## a mission or doing good cause.

Each company needs to have their mission or doing good cause well defined.
This needs to be a well defined mission and needs to be easy understood by all.

## core values

### 100% transparency

#### company/organization

100% transparant

- code, bugs, feature requests (to world)
- product information & roadmap (to world)
- financials (P&L, budget vs costs) (\*)
- strategic information (\*)
- internal company planning (story cards) (\*)
- detailed sales funnel & project information (\*)

We need to make sure that information is always up to date & available online. Our members should be able to find the information at any point in time. Information which needs to be version controlled like contracts should have a version nr e.g. v1.2. We are a modern company sending information around as pdf over email is not doable because it does not allow us to make sure everyone has the same up to date information.

(\*) to all company members and to Ambassador & Foundation Board (see [governance structure](foundation_governance_structure.md))


#### individual

- don't be afraid to be open about ANYTHING
- don't be afraid to question & be vocal about quality, productivity, ...
- don't hide behind other people

### be modest

We are working on a big ambitious project but that does not give us the right to be unrespectful to any other party or to boost about our abilities.

Forbidden words are: 'world class', 'best in class', 'extreme ...', ...

We should not spend money we don't have. Its our duty to stay lean and mean until we get the proof from the market which allows us to grow our organization more. Every $ counts. Ego should not get in the way.

### respect effort & be efficient

Time is a valuable asset it allows us to create and grow. We need to protect this asset and even more important we need to respect effort delivered by others.

- be efficient
    - Write concise text & structural
    - DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
    - Learn the tools (git(tea), google docs, trello)
    - Don't copy, reuse where possible
    - 20-80% rule: always try to have maximum impact by minimal effort
- organize your work
    - make sure that information is up to date (delete all old content)
    - make sure that information is in the right location
    - stick to our chosen tools & follow our contribution guidelines
- communicate better (not more, better!)
    - communicate about work done
    - communicate about work which needs to be done
    - communicate about your goals and plans
- improve don't replace
    - improve other people's work and if not possible communicate before doing anything

### believe in our doing good cause.

If customers or partners do not believe in our values or in our good causes then we should not try to work with them. Do not accept half baked solutions.

### respect for money

- Money is a form of energy and is required in the current world to achieve goals. We need it to create & deploy our technology.
- We cannot achieve our goals without friends who are willing to use their money to help us to achieve our goals. We need to have respect for their funding and do everything we can to provide a good return on investment, which is of course very fair and normal.
- We believe its also important to look for investors who believe in our values.
- We need to make sure that every $ is used to its utmost potential, this is much more easily said than done.
	- HR: always make sure that people provide the right level of contribution in line with their salary.
	- Don't grow when not ready yet, stay lean and mean as long as possible.
	- Don't do wishful thinking, often money is being spent too early waiting for future things to happen.
	- By being more effective and forcing the company to be effective goals can be achieved with less money.
	- Don't accept shortcuts, any shortcut eventually leads to situations where more money will be lost.


### maintain high levels of quality.

This is not easy for a startup, pressure is high and find the right balance between speed & quality is difficult.
We believe though that shortcuts should never been taken. Its wrong and will hurt afterwards.

If mistakes are made (unavoidable) we need to transparant about it and show the path to better quality.


### be loyal to our values

It's not an easy job to be constantly in line with above values.
Its our job to help our friends & colleagues to honor these values and if not at least tell them.
This takes courage and is not easy.


## how do we try to achieve our values/goals (ThreeFold)?

### neutral

Blockchain technology allows us to create a 100% distributed infrastructure which is owned by many thousands hopefully once millions of users.

### private

Your data is yours and only yours, cannot be abused by anyone.
Our identity management system (ItsYou.Online) lives on top of our blockchain and gives you an ultra private & secure way to store your information (encryption keys, tel nr's, ...).

By means of our blockchain we can make sure no-one is in control, all together we secure our network of capacity. Only rightful people get access to right information.

### cost efficient

Needs to be affordable for all of us.
We develop technology which allows us to use hardware much more efficient.

### Green

Upto 10x power savings is possible, see this [ThreeFold Blog](https://threefoldtoken.com/information/10-times-power-savings/).

### local for everyone

Local means better performance, no need for your traffic to go over expansive fiber lines to another continent.


### open cultures (teal organizations)

- [open cultures] (https://danieltenner.com/open-cultures/): lots of info about how new style organizations can be build. This is really a must read and something we actively try to work towards.
