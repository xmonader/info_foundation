3 types

- zero-os = our operating system
- tf chain = our blockchain

we have 10 Guardians per type.

Responsibilities

- Investigate all changes made to code before a release
- When a release do all the builds (compilation) and publish the builds
- Sign the builds so everyone in the field knows that the guardian has verified the quality of the code and has compiled to code (avoid backdoors)

Why

Anyone in the community can download builds (binaries) from any of the tech guardians and as such have more security that the code was properly created and compiled.

Remarks

- Tech guardians will receive TF Tokens for their work.
