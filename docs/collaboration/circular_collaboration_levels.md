# Circular Collaboration Level

![](images/levels.png)

## Intro

We don't believe in pyramids, we believe in circles where everyone has a very important role to play.
Freedom comes with a lot of responsibility. Many of us are still stuck in the hierarchical (fear) based way of working. Many want to go higher up and be able to make decisions.
We strongly don't agree with this way of working, there is no “up”. Everyone is the center of their circle.
By giving respect to others and being transparent in your plans and work others will follow you based on the quality of your work, not based on the level you have in an organization. In our world, everyone is "a boss" but this needs to be deserved.

We believe everyone needs to work together in a truly peaceful way and empower each other to co-create and make the chosen joint dream reality.

Not everyone is on the same capability level in his/her career. We have defined some levels which can help us to work together and think about ways to grow on a professional and personal level. We believe this will help us to grow and become more effective as an organization and community. 

The first thing which needs to happen is that we agree with these capability levels and see the need to make progress in them. In case you don't feel these levels are ok for you it probably means another type of organization is better for you to work with.

## our levels

- Pup: young, need to learn a lot, passionate, wants to grow
- Wolf: ambitious, still a little bit careless, still need to learn, but already very efficient
- Elephant: protector of the others, example, can learn & guide others, strong & reliable
- Dolphin: smart = wisdom & experience, an expert in less = more, always thinks before doing, can teach others
- Eagle: the top, can fly anywhere, can do anything, has lots of freedom

Let's be clear: we all make mistakes, that's perfectly ok, that's the way how we learn. The focus is on a personal commitment to demonstrable growth. This also implies that no-one should want to stay in the pup level.

We are an ambitious startup and we can't build our dreams with only pups. We'll need wolves, elephants, and dolphins.

We also consider the personal growth to be very important, it's not just about business and technology.

We have created [a test which can potentially help you to define your level](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ToPlNUr_R2GeN_PTyVSdb0ITXm6jjRzD6FAw6N1FpVE/edit#gid=999956966)

We believe it's super important that people work on their own development, quite some information has been written about this already, we hope below gives you inspiration:

- STARTING POINT: [www.freeflownation.org/manifesto](https://www.freeflownation.org/manifesto.html)


- [ethical_design_manifesto](ethical_design_manifesto.md)
- [goals_values](goals_values.md)
- [kristof_build_a_better_world_manifesto](kristof_build_a_better_world_manifesto.md)
- [responsive_org_manifesto](responsive_org_manifesto.md)
- [the_art_of_being_loyal_to_your_values](the_art_of_being_loyal_to_your_values.md)
- [XQ](XQ.md)

Of course, this is only the starting point, growing into your own path is a life mission.
