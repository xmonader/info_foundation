# Notes:
## From the Book Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux  

## Different types of organizations:

- Red = gang, wolfpack - Alpha dominates, division of labor
- Amber = Army, church - everyone wheres a uniform - does their job
- Orange = machine, measure everything, test performance

## Now Teal = new organization structure

### 3 Breakthroughs:  

All Teal organizations are based on:				

1. Self-management. Teal organizations have found the key to upgrading their structures from hierarchical, bureaucratic pyramids to powerful and fluid systems of distributed authority and collective intelligence					
1. Wholeness.  Organizations have always been places that encourage people to show up with a narrow “professional” self. Teal organizations have developed a consistent set of practices that invite us to drop the mask, reclaim our inner wholeness, and bring all of who we are to work.
1. Evolutionary purpose.  Teal organizations are seen as having a life and a sense of direction of their own. Instead of trying to predict and control the future, members of the organization are invited to listen and understand what the organization is drawn to become, where it naturally wants to go. 


### Example - Buurtzorg Nurses:  

How are they Teal? 

* Run teams in self governing groups of 10-12 by neighborhood - no bosses

Do we agree?

* Definitely agree that pods of nurses can be efficient

Really - what should we amend?

* The nurses dont have bosses - true
* However - the nurses do have a (top down) central management who assigns the patients to the group and pays the nurses etc

### Example - FAVI Automotive:  

How are they Teal? 

* Once a week, the sales account person from, say, the Audi mini-factory meets with his team- mates to share the order for the week. 
* Everyone joins in the joy if the order is large or the disappointment if the order is small. 
* Planning happens on the spot, and the team jointly agrees on a shipping date.
* Sometimes, the sales account person has bad news to share: Chinese competition quoted a very low price. Can we match it? 
* People knock their heads together and figure out if they feel they can shave another few minutes off the machining process. 
* The teammates don’t have—and don’t need—targets or bosses. They face their clients and competitors directly and know that their jobs depend on doing a good job and making wise decisions. They are proud of the work they do and their capacity to self-organize. 

Do we agree?

* QBs (or stakeholders) sit around table and real time work together on the project or initiative…
* Reduces iterations and time massively vs people working in isolation


### Advice Process:  

How are they Teal? 

* Any person can start a project - begin working - and transact (example used in the book is buying a machine in a factory)
* However, the point person who makes the proposal must solicit advice from the key stakeholders
* The bigger the project - the more stakeholders / advice

Really - what should we amend?

* Don’t agree that just any employee can pull the trigger and buy the machine.  Reduces iterations and time massively vs people working in isolation
* Would have final stakeholder meeting to agree and / or modify as required - then the QB can pull the trigger

			
		
### Advice Process - Chairman / CEO level:  
How are they Teal? 
* Example is nursing
* Jos (CEO) circulates his big picture thinking to everyone
* Everyone comments (if they want)

Do we agree?
* Think this is a pretty good approach

Really - what should we amend?
* Probably works better to circulate to smaller (but still comprehensive) group of QBs before circulating to everyone
* This will save time as everyone reads (and reacts to) the Chairman’s messages - and we want to be respectful of their time


### Morningstar - self pay:  
How are they Teal? 
* People propose their own pay
* A panel of workers volunteers  is selected to take decisions re over pay or under pay
* Panel decision is final (within limits)

Do we agree?
* Not really

Really - what should we amend?
* The question that is not addressed is:  how does one determine the value contributed by the employee?
* This is the most important question in my view
* The whole process fails if you get this wrong


### Wholeness:
How are they Teal? 
* Everyone sees the big picture
* Everyone can challenge the strategy
* Everyone can police values

Do we agree?
* Totally 100%
* In fact we (TF + GIG + JV + IYO +APP) need to a better job of this - folks should know what other folks are doing

Really - what should we amend?
* No amendments

### Safe Space:  
How are they Teal? 
* Folks should fee safe at work - and empowered to make change suggest etc

Do we agree?
* Totally

Really - what should we amend?
* Book is talking about big issues liek sexual harassment etc
* Think there are also small situations such as scratch boards / initial drafts etc - people should feel comfortable that they can put forward work-in-progress and ideas without too much criticism if they turn out to be bad ideas…


### Awareness - Reflection:  
How are they Teal? 
* Allow all employees to meditate be aware practice mindfulness
* Example: meditation, coaching, mindfulness day

Do we agree?
* Totally

Really - what should we amend?
* Its fine.  No amendment

### Meetings:  
How are they Teal? 
* Ensure a policeman keeps meetings safe

Do we agree?
* I think fine

Really - what should we amend?
* I would suggest people - more than one (hopefully) be prepared to keep meetings:
* Safe
* In line w values and quality
* Efficient

### Commitments outside work:  
How are they Teal? 
* Let everyone keep commitments outside work
* Accommodate

Do we agree?
* Totally

Really - what should we amend?
* Its fine.  No amendment


### Higher Purpose:  
How are they Teal? 
* Company should be driven by an ambitious higher goal

Do we agree?
* Yes

Really - what should we amend?
* Agree


### No strategic planning - “sense and respond” instead:  
How are they Teal? 
* Read and react real time
* Keeps customer / company issues front and center
* Plans never come true anyway

Do we agree?
* Not really
* Really - what should we amend?
* Better approach is to plan (not overplan) and start doing immediately
* Doing is better than perfect
* We will know when we are wrong and we can pivot


### No budgets:  
How are they Teal? 
* Sense and respond again

Do we agree?
* Not really

Really - what should we amend?
* Budgets are healthy - force people to think
* Also we need to maintain a minimum cash runway
* Sense and respond may tell you “hire 100 people”


### Chrm CEO and BoD must lead by example:  
How are they Teal? 
* CEO must be Teal or no one will follow
* BoD must also be Teal

Do we agree?
* For CEO definitely

Really - what should we amend?
* A Teal BoD is an interesting proposition
* BoD’s tend to be fairly Orange - review progress, set targets and strategies, assess risks
