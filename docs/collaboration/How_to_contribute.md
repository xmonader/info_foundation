We believe in "self-healing organizations" where circles (teams organized around topics) collaborate with each other. It's similar to how our own human body works. For instance: lungs provide oxygen to the body but they need red-blood cells to move the oxygen to the rest of the body; the brain can tell us where to drive, but it needs hands and feet to operate the car.

Organizations like this give a lot of independence to their contributors. However, the organizations can only succeed if contributors know what is expected of them and are willing to follow a set of mutually agreed principles to ensure harmonious and effective working together. Of course not every contributor is the same.

Information flow and discipline is very important in such an organization.

We are all contributors one way or the other but to make it easy we would like to make distinction between 5 different types of contributors:

- ThreeFold sponsor = anyone who likes to help ThreeFold in adhoc manner 
- ThreeFold guardian = they guard the values of our movement (technical or governance)
- ThreeFold ambassador = anyone who wants to contribute at least a couple of hours per month for our joint cause and is not afraid to adopt our tools and way of working
- ThreeFold founder = works as part of ThreeFold team at least 50% of time and is 100% in on our way of working and values.
- ThreeFold coordinator = coordination role (owner of one or more circles) 

## ThreeFold Sponsor

Anyone who believes in what we do and would like to assist.
Please work together with any of our Ambassadors who will be very happy to assist you in anything you would like to help us with. We grately appreciate any contribution offered.

Some examples of what we are looking for:

- LEADS: names of people who might be interested in farming capacity or buying tokens or investing in TF Tech.
- EVENT CO-ORDINATION: help us organize an event for Token or Grid promotion.
- FEEDBACK: technical feedback on the technology we have created or on any of the things we do.

If you want to collaborate please get in touch through our [Foundation website](https://threefold.io/more_info/) or [email](info@threefoldtoken.com).

## ThreeFold Ambassador

ThreeFold has hundreds of Ambassadors today, we are super grateful that so many people want to help our movement.

Because of our decentralized nature it's super important that Ambassadors are willing to learn the basics of our tools which will make it easier to collaborate.

The main tool are our circles, please look at our [circles](/collaboration/circles.md) and see where you would like to contribute. Each circle has an owner, please contact the owner (coordinator) and ask how you can help and what you need to be effective.

### Practical Requirements

We realize we ask a lot from our Ambassadors but we believe it is a must to be effective.

In case this is too much please work with any of our Ambassadors who will glady help you and be at service of you to make you successful as a ThreeFold Sponsor.

You are willing to:

- Learn our adapted agile methodology (circles, stories...) and get fluent with it, it's a lot easier than you think! We will be creating some video's about this soon.
    - [trello usage](/collaboration/trello_usage.md) & [circle tools](/collaboration/circles_tools.md)
    - [story cards](/collaboration/stories.md)
    - [circles roles](/collaboration/circles_roles.md)
- Learn how to create/use [story cards](/collaboration/stories.md) (its an art by itself)
    - report on the work done in the stories and always help to keep the stories up to date
- Feel comfortable being 100% open to everyone about anything
- Not try to be perfect, 20% effort gets any goal to 80% of requirements. It does not pay off to try to be perfect.
- Keep all your work open, when you start working on something make sure everyone else can follow the process, don't first create and then contribute, it's much better to have your work accessible while you improve (e.g. a google document, or multiple iterations of markdown documents).
- Deliver work which is good enough
    - not perfect (see above) but good enough to achieve the requirements as mentioned in a story card.
- Give feedback to others and escalate when required (in a loving way)
- Respect the contribution of others, improve where possible, if the contribution is not good enough please go back to the author, discuss and try to help.

### Remarks

- Each Ambassador has their own ThreeFold related email addresses and is part of our internal tool ecosystem (google docs, github, mattermost, ...)

## ThreeFold Founder

We really believe that the world is changing. Many people choose to no longer follow the brainwashed way of living where fear dominates all. Please read our article about the [art of being loyal to our values](https://medium.com/@despiegk/the-art-of-being-loyal-to-your-values-e0e6e3f310f7) and [build a better world together manifesto](https://docs.grid.tf/dividi/values/src/branch/master/kristof_build_a_better_world_manifesto.md)
To become a TF Founder it's essential that this documents resonate with you.

If we want ThreeFold to have an impact on the world, our Founders need to set an example. Being a ThreeFold Founder is difficult, few have the courrage and the will to work on their self improvement to be such an example.

Its not about technical skill or being a strong leader, it's all about using love and respect to get things done.

A ThreeFold Founder is willing to work on self-improvement:

- to understand their own shortcomings
- to love and have respect for themselves and can love and respect others
- to be able to show appreciation and respect for others effort, for people and for our community
- is not afraid to trust people, wants others to be successful and is willing to take action to help them succeed
- is not afraid of being different and will keep on pushing for the values the group believes in
- knows that intuition is real and that it is not just knowledge or experience that counts
- is not afraid to be 100% transparent
- is not afraid to ask others for help
- is a good communicator
- can structure and document work, strategies, specifications, workflows and processes - has great communication skills

A ThreeFold Founder understands and endorses:

* [Thre FreeFlow Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4R8LCF6oasrrJMe8hsu2yLjtAKYVseuLjpOyyMYEHg/edit)

### How to become a TF Founder?

- Make sure you have enough time available to be a TF Founder and you are not afraid to do things differently.
- You need to be willing to go the extra mile and always put the ThreeFold mission & values first.
- Make sure you have really taken the time to read above and it resonates with you.
- You need to be a loyal and skilled TF Ambassador.
- Existing TF Founders need to endorse you.

Note:

Most of our ambassadors like these values and are really good examples but don't have the time to be a TF Founder. We would like to thank you so much for helping us and be that example for others.

## ThreeFold Coordinator 

A coordinator is owner of one or more circles.

A coordindator is a TF Founder who also has coordination and communication skills and likes to be at service of others in helping them to collaborate and to grow.

- Coordinators manage circles.
- Circles can have subcircles which can have other subcircles...
- A circle is a group of people working together around a set of specific topics.
- A coordinator in an agile organization does not control, has no decision power.

It's the reverse of an authoritative, or autocratic power play. A coordinator does not command or take decisions. Decisions happen automatically because an agile process is being followed. A coordinator makes sure others can easily contribute and they can find all the information they require, they discover and clear road-blocks and make it possible for people to be their best, its about getting the process to work smoothly without being in the way.

A coordinator:

- is at service of the circle or the larger community they work for
- makes sure that:
  - every contributor of the circle understands and follows the agile principles and becomes a good contributor
  - the mission or strategy of the circle is known & understood - documentation e.g. a wiki is ideal
  - the goals are translated into achieveable work and this happens by means of [stories](/collaboration/stories.md)
  - quality [stories](/collaboration/stories.md) are created (well explained, done is done, requirements known, a story is not a task)
  - stakeholders have input on the stories and they can follow progress
  - story owner's (people who own a specific story) can do their duty (keep to time, have the resources they need, know the specific goal of the story, know who and how to escalate to, make use of comments to clearly track progress)
- is a teacher or coach
  - they get alongside people and help them be their best
  - they help people to become a better contributor
  - are able to explain why agile principles work so well within an organization like ours

My personal estimate is that less than 1% of existing professionals have the skill to be a good TF Coordinator, its not an easy job.

The following information should feel interesting & valuable:

- [Responsible Efika Owner](https://docs.grid.tf/dividi/efika/src/branch/master/efika_owner.md)
- [Head of mission](head_of_mission_profile.md)

How to become a TF Coordinator.

- Make sure you like to help other to contribute better to the ThreeFold Foundation causes.
- You need to be a skilled TF Founder.
- Existing TF Founders & TF Coordinators need to endorse you.

- tf chain = our blockchain

we have 10 Guardians per type.

Responsibilities

- Investigate all changes made to code before a release
- When a release do all the builds (compilation) and publish the builds
- Sign the builds so everyone in the field knows that the guardian has verified the quality of the code and has compiled to code (avoid backdoors)

Why

Anyone in the community can download builds (binaries) from any of the tech guardians and as such have more security that the code was properly created and compiled.

Remarks

- Tech guardians will receive TF Tokens for their work.
