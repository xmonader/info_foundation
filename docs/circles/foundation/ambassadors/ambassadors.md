## Purpose/Mission
ThreeFold founders believe the internet should be neutral, sustainable, and accessible to all. So we're building it. Internet compute and storage capacity democratized - Open source software that creates neutral, green and private capacity by people for people. 100% decentralized!

Our ambassadors are an integral part of this movement.

Over the coming months, the ThreeFold Grid will be expanding throughout the world and will be be hosting a variety of meetups and conferences throughout the world. ThreeFold is looking to collaborate with various people, groups and companies to accomplish this goal.  From application development to social outreach, each individual Ambassador can lend a unique skill or quality to our growing community.

- Community building. Help spread the word, open up networks, have an advisory role, organize and host events.
- Technology and Blockchain professional and enthusiasts. 

## ThreeFold Ambassador Goals

- Execute ambassador led ThreeFold events in all relevant markets.
- Have 20+ active working groups composed of ambassadors and ThreeFold staff addressing relevant challenges and opportunities of ThreeFold by end of 2019.

## Strategy

- Develop a program which enables scalable knowledge sharing between ambassadors and ThreeFold.  
- Search for, recruit, engage and retain ambassadors to the joint benefit of both ambassadors and ThreeFold.
- Recruit guardians for the ThreeFold Trust from the existing pool of ambassadors and if needed from outside - being referred by ThreeFold members and ambassadors.
- Extend ambassador community work to include friends and family and others - assuming they want a more active role in designing the future and success of ThreeFold.
- Create a category of ambassadors that includes market-making influencers and big names within the industry that endorse and support the ThreeFold project in various areas, speak at events for us and give us advice.
