Any existing TF Token holder can sell their tokens during the TDE, of course. After the TDE period of 2 months, the tokens will be liquid on at least 3 chosen public exchanges.

Amongst others, Mazraa as the first ThreeFold cooperative will be selling TFTs from the genesis pool. A genesis pool is the first created farming pool for the ThreeFold Grid and has been used to develop and demonstrate the technology. 

Further mentioned terms are under review and can change.

The basic terms of the TDE are the following:
The maximum amount of tokens that can be resold during this TDE is no more than 200M TFT.
Tokens will be sold at predefined prices for a 2 month period.
The launching price will be USD 0.12

Our aim is to start the TDE end of October 2019 and it will last for 2 months.
