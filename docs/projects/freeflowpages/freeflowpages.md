# FreeFlowPages

FreeFlowPages is a social network that runs on ThreeFolds decentralized capacity network. 
Each user will have full control over personal data and will be able to create a social page where they can connect with other users on a democratized social news platform. 

One of the most exciting features of FreeFlow Pages is that it runs on “3Bot technology” which uses personal virtual assistants to protect users experiences and interactions online, ensuring maximum privacy and security because only verified user 3Bots can exchange information. Furthermore, ones personal space is no longer just a space to explore social news, you will be able to exchange value with a decentralized built in wallet, an addon for a decentralized video chat, and secure decentralized chat platform, where all the features are centered on user privacy and experience. 

It could be that the name will be rebranded to OpenWiki
