3Bot, a virtual service assistant, is an intelligent digital avatar which assists a person or group of people run in a ThreeFold Container. 3Bot is your secure personal virtual systems administrator and
data, communications & transactions manager. Your online guardian and our virtual hero! 

3Bots manage and enable both the ThreeFold and FreeFlow Ecosystems. 

To function properly and remain active on the TF Grid each 3Bot requires ThreeFold Grid capacity and thus ThreeFold Tokens. [Fees](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/blob/master/doc/3bot.md#fees)

This project is one of the major use cases on the TF Grid and itâ€™s a non-profit initiative.
