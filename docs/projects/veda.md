# Veda Retreats

Veda’s mission is to offer support and guidance to those who feel the calling to increase awareness. To help you find that place of inner peace and softness. Our world can be rigid, limiting, controlling, fearful and most of us are trying to find places to escape. But, what if you can find that harmonious and joyful place completely inside you? Veda organizes events on the Nile and in Ibiza open to all who want to participate.

Veda is going to launch an asset-backed token on ThreeFold Grid with the total of:

    - 2.5m EUR current assets
        - 4 boats (39 rooms in total).
        - 6000m2 land.
    - 3m EUR extra will be added:
        - For buying new assets = 4 new boats, each boat €750k fully done.
        - These boats will be used for building schools
    - 500k EUR tokens for future effort, payment for team members (salaries, …)
        - Y1 = 200k
        - Y2 = 100k
        - Y3/4/5/6 = 50k

Also, Veda is planning to launch a charity-purpose Education Token 
    - 1 Education tokens used = 1 TF Token (white label).
    - Will give possibility for people to fund the learning programs.
    - Each student gets X tokens as a reward which can only use for education.
