# EuroFlow Token

EuroFlow Token (EFT) is a project in collaboration with ThreeFold and NBH Digital EU.

Euros € (fiat) are exchanged 1:1 for EFT’s which are printed and held in a digital wallet. Each EFT is backed by an equal amount of Euros held as collateral in reserve accounts. Furthermore, EFTs will be backed by Gold (hedged value) to protect against bank crashes, and will provide an even further security and stable digital Euros. ETFs can then easily be used to purchase all paired digital currencies in an instant. Finally, EFTs can be restituted back into Euros at the same 1:1 rate. Redeemed EFTs are then burned. 

The EuroFlow project will follow all legally necessary KYC/AML requirements. It will be obligated to list daily assets statements and adhere to regularly scheduled independent audits vouching the existence of all Euros backing each EFT which will then be hashed to the blockchain.

Runs on the TF Grid, using TF blockchain technology.
- 1 EuroFlow Token = 1 € Euro .
- Need bank (or financial institution) that would facilitate heavy transactional usage in/out of digital currency and Euro fiat. - We are currently checking jurisdictional and regulatory requirements in both Malta and Cyprus.

Summary: 
- TF will provide a Euro tokenization platform as a tokenized asset which will be backed 1:1 by collateral held in reserve accounts. 
- TF will provide various reserve verification such as audits by an independently licensed European accounting firm.
- This will give the ability to bridge fiat entry to the TF Platform.
