# ThreeFold Foundation Projects and Partnerships

This section has been put together for the TF community to follow the progress of the ThreeFold Ecosystem. The Ecosystem includes strategic partnerships, token economies and application platforms that all live on our new internet. We list the different projects currently being worked on and the ones that are in the planning stage giving structure to the TF Ecosystem as we continue to grow and organize the many people and organizations who want to help, get actively involved, and become significant contributors.

Collaboration is one of our core values and we would love for you to contribute to make our mission a reality. Please visit the [How to contribute](https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/info_foundation/#/collaboration/contributing_in_agile_org) section for instructions.
