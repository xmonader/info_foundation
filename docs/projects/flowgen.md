# FlowGen

FlowGen is a renewable energy company that applied its extensive aerodynamic know-how from the automotive racing industry into the wind industry to optimize the design of a 5-meter wind turbine. These turbines can be installed virtually anywhere without the need for high masts or deep foundations. This makes it possible to cost-effectively deliver power nearly anywhere in the world.

Together with FlowGen, ThreeFold can push Internet capacity for a fair price to the places that need it the most.
