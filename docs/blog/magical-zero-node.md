# The Magical Zero-Node

The guiding design principle is that simpler solutions increase efficiency and productivity. 

Less = More

The Zero-OS (Stateless Operating System) node technology is based on technology that has been developed and innovated for 15 years in an incubation center. Mid to late 90’s some were working for a large American firm that was investing in creating Europe’s first large scale (internet) datacenters and internet connectivity.  In that period 5 major datacenters were built and put into production. It became frustrating to see the amount of money, time and energy required to architect, install, operate and maintain complex IT infrastructures. It was a very passionate time where better technology was created which addresses these issues.


To build a technology stack from point solutions from A-brand vendors requires a tremendous amount of integration software,equipment and knowledge / human resource effort.  The result is a very complicated operational setup that costs a lot of money, uses a lot of power and requires a large amount of maintenance contracts and engineers.


This inspired us to create more effective IT architectures powering IT workloads without all the complexity and unnecessary components by starting an incubation center to specifically develop technologies creating more efficient ways of doing very standard things:  


* Use more of the available compute power by virtualisation technologies allowing multiple tenants to use one physical machine.
* Create a performing and reliable storage solution by using standard off the shelf components and staying as far away as possibly from proprietary hard- and software to enhance storage performance.
* Create a low level power management device that is able to manage and monitor the whole upstream power feed and creates efficient power consumption.  One of the key aspects of this technology is that it measures Voltage and Amperage 25k times a second, which provides very detailed information about how the power supply is “consuming” energy  and allows for analytical failure prediction.


A Zero-Node consists of hardware and software. A Zero Node can be purchased from the TF Foundation or by downloading and installing software on existing re-purposed hardware.
