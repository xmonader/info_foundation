# Open Source Technology

## An overview of our technology components

### Open Source Components Overview

The following components are used to build our grid and deliver unequivalent benefits in power optimization, performance & scale.

- [Jumpscale  = Automation Framework](https://github.com/Jumpscale)
- [Distributed OS = Zero-OS](https://github.com/zero-os)
- [Neutral identity management](https://github.com/itsyouonline)
- [More Scalable Blockchain](https://github.com/rivine)

### Open Source Architecture Components

#### Zero-OS

True Distributed OS
Managed By Our Zero-OS Controller

It is a very different type of OS

- No more local filesystems
- No more a volume driver
- No more local packages, software installations..
- No terminal (like ssh, ...)

Zero OS Components

- Zero-OS core (replacement of systemd, kernel boots this first process)
- Zero-OS filesystem (virtual filesystem for Zero-OS, OS files are not installed on local storage)
- Zero-OS vDisk (virtual Disks running 0-OS FS)
- Zero-OS cockpit (AYS - self-healing, jumpscale portal, restAPI, Telegram interface)
- Zero-OS CLI - command line tools

#### Zero Storage (part of Zero-OS)

- Easy to use
- 1 IT person can manage 100 Petabyte
- Dense & Environmentally friendly
- 5PB in 1 rack for archive
- Using conventional disks for storage
- Super scale out 50+ PB
- Multi datacenter with single namespace
- Not based on replication
- Can lose datacenters, data remains available
- Ultra high performance 100-250.000 IOPS per node (depends on HW)
- Ultra reliable
- Replication & backup obsolete
- Space efficient 2-3x better than alternatives (NAS & Archive)
- Self-healing

#### Cockpit (= Jumpscale / At Your Service)

- Enables anyone to design and deploy virtual datacenters in minutes
- Open source, free of charge software
- Comprehensive: human readable, easy to learn format
- No more complicated technical oriented configuration files
- No networking, virtualization or storage expertise required
- Concentrate on business process automation, not IT
- Runs on any Zero-OS, eliminating layers of complexity
- With ready-to-deploy blueprints available off-the-shelf
- Blueprint marketplaces
- Manage full IT lifecycles leveraging container technology
- Grow, add, distribute, and destroy capacity when needed
- No downtime: Change and upgrades are immediate
- Design Intelligence: Robots and algorithms assist you

#### TF Chain (Rivine based blockchain)

- Proof Of Stake Blockchain = Sustainable
- Smart contracts
- Low transaction fees
- Supports atomic swap
- Used to reserve capacity on the TF Grid
