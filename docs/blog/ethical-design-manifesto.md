## How to create products in an ethical, human friendly way.

## Respect Human Rights

- Sustainable = green (our world needs some help)
- Available for all: which also means affordable, not owned by a big company with as purpose greed
- Decentralized: make sure technology is available everywhere
- Open & Interoperable: allow technology to work together in an open way
- Accessible: easy to access, fast enough, everywhere in the world
- Secure & Private: your privacy is a right

##  Respect Human Effort

- Make sure technology is reliable and lasts longer (no need to replace in 5 years)
- Avoid Complexity (KIS - keep it simple): no unnecessary complexity
- LESS = MORE (do less to achieve more)
- Let people/companies work together in a 100% transparent way

## Respect Human Experience

- Products should be ergonomic & easy to use
- Design should be global and inclusive: don’t favour certain user groups!
- Products should look good, but form follow function
- TRANSPARENCY: sales, pricing, processes…
