###  We have launched four new websites and there is more to come

As members of a fast-moving startup we know it can be hard to keep track of everything, especially for people looking at us from the outside.
To better reflect all the changes and news, we decided to take a different approach and cut up our website into separate websites that all have their respective focal point.


**TFtokens**: [TFtokens.com](http://tftokens.com/)
<br> This website is 100% dedicated to all regarding TFTs.
How to create a wallet, where to trade them and of course: how much are they worth at this point in time?
Everything you need to know is on here.

**TFfarmers**: [TFfarmers.com](http://tffarmers.com/)
<br> Are you a techie looking to build your own DIY farm and add it to our grid?
Or less of a techie but still want to add capacity to our grid through a Farming Cooperative?
This is the website you want to keep an eye out for!

**ThreeFold Radar**: [threefoldradar.info](http://threefoldradar.info)
<br> All the latest info on trade volumes, farmed blocks, tokens pricing, and more can be found here in a quick overview.
Please note that the maps in the bottom are not yet a true representation of the current state of our grid; this will be updated soon!

**ThreeFold Impact**: [threefoldimpact.com](http://threefoldimpact.com/)
<br> ThreeFold Impact is a socially responsible development vehicle seeded by the threefold foundation to accelerate adoption of the threefold cloud technology in emerging markets.


**ThreeFold Foundation**: [threefoldtoken.com](http://threefoldtoken.com/)
<br> Will soon get an overhaul as well to get all of our websites in the same line and look & feel.
We will keep you posted on our social media channels and weekly updates..
