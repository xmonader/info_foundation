## Everyone should be able to deliver capacity to the new neutral internet.

**In this article we discuss the general concept of ‘decentralized grid’ and more practical questions of becoming part of it.**

### Decentralization & empowering the edge trend

The Internet decentralized information and changed the world as we know it. Now blockchain technology is decentralizing value and could change the world even more.

The Internet allowed everyone to generate and exchange content freely. Companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter and Snapchat made big business out of it. And the “sharing economy” is growing during the last 5-10 years due to the simplified information flow and well developed technology, which:

1. Allows much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy
2. Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of the marketplace operator

We are coming to the flat-structure economy, where less managerial levels are needed for the system to function properly.

Blockchain technology facilitates this trend. Participants can interact on a peer-to-peer basis and form marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.

### The very core of IT

It is surprising that - despite aleady seeing well known examples of decentralized currencies, transportation, lodging and ledgers - we do not yet have decentralized datacenter technology, the very core of the internet as we know it.

At the moment, it requires tremendous $ investment and massive scale to compete effectively in the Internet IT capacity market. Large companies like Alibaba, Amazon, EMC, Google and Microsoft are dominant.

ThreeFold has developed for the last years on distributed datacenter technology. One of the benefits of distributed datacenter technology is that it allows small organizations - even individuals - to participate in the Internet IT capacity market.

With the Zero-OS technology, you can jump into the market even if you have a couple of hundred dollars to invest. All such participants are called ThreeFold Farmers (TFM).

### How you can join

The process to become a TF Farmer is very straightforward.  Anyone - whether individual, professional or corporate - can join the TF Grid by buying a Zero Node and downloading the Zero-OS open source software. You can even do it with your existing spare hardware.

Now you can operate your micro datacenter and earn money on it, we call this process TF Mining.

Our Zero-Nodes are designed to be “plug and play” with full self driving capability - meaning TF Farmers do not need to have IT experience.

The Internet Capacity produced by the Zero-Node is automatically registered on the TF Directory which is made public to global purchasers of Internet Capacity. There is no need to build a marketing department or promote your micronode. As long as the price is reasonable, there will be demand capacity near your location.

For convenience, pricing is set by the TF Directory algorithm based on numerous factors including real time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment. More advanced TF Farmers can set their pricing if desired.

Now you essentially can become an ‘AirBnB’ TF Farmer for the new, neutral internet which belongs to all of us.

 - No more big corporations are controlling the grid and wasting resources..
 - Yes to the new decentralized, neutral and green internet.
