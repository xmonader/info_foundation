# How do small-scale farmers complete with farmers with more extensive capacity?

## Question

Since software performance is a function of the applications being run, the hardware requirements of a software application (internet speed, compute performance, storage capacity, security) place demands on the capacity of the ThreeFold grid. How do farmers configure their hardware in order to satisfy what a consumer or business might need. Will small-scale farmers be shut out from clients either because they cannot provide sufficient capacity for the most common applications, or because the larger nearby farmers can run a more profitable service because of their scale of operation?

## Answer

Initially we will be presenting [unmanaged](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_foundation/blob/master/docs/definitions/threefold_unmanaged_capacity.md) capacity only. This unmanaged capacity will presented by farmers from homes, offices, no datacenter locations and datacenter locations. Everyone will be presenting the same type of capacity at the start in smaller or larger quantities. So this is not a problem initially.
