## Community Development

Each person working in this area has a monthly cost which is combination of

- Own salary (if any)
- Time used from team (which also costs)
- Other expenses

Eventually each community developer need to have a positive contribution to TF. It's maybe not the most hippie way how to look at this but this is our responsibility towards our community. 

Some projects can be long term projects where impact is not there immediate but still then it needs to be made visible to our team and even community so that people understand where money goes to and why. Each longer term project should be on our wiki & defined.

## Community Support

Basically helping members of our community to be effective.
E.g. doing events, giving speeches, helping people to farm, help them to find info, help them to buy tokens, help them with delivery/logistics ...

Creating & maintaining info is for these people the most important part of their job.
There needs to be a shared responsibility of making sure that at any point in time the info is up to date & relevant. Before doing yet another zoom call, make sure info is there.

##  Tech Support

Help our community with our systems (internal IT as well as the TF Grid)
Make sure people have the right experience also here documentation is key.

##  Product Development

Create the products which make all of this possible.

A website/wiki is a product !!!
It's something with version nr’s, it needs to be managed, controlled, improved.

Some of us are responsible for creating/delivering these products.

Each product is 100% managed on github, not trello !!! (exception community facing roadmap with community understandable messaging) 

## Foundation Coordination

- help coordinate how the foundation works
- check that each $ spend provides value creation for the ThreeFold Foundation community
- make sure that people involved are able to be effective and provide support where required
- official functions (company related)
