## why do I exist in TF 

- To help other be the succeed and be the best they can. I selfishly thoroughly enjoy seeing people succeed and by doing so I feel I have in turn succeeded.

Whether it is TF or any project I personally spend time on, my contribution to the people working on the project is to make sure that we are personally growing towards a the goal that on a basic level answers the question "are you leaving this world in a better place than you found it today?".

- Master of "the books" (CPA)
- Coordinate Operations
- Spread the message (in general)
