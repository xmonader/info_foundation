Dear Community,

It's my pleasure to give you an intro to quite some updates which are going to follow over next days/weeks.

**Event**

We had an amazing event in Ibiza a couple weeks ago. We were planning for 50 people but more than 70 people attended and we had to stop accepting registrations, sorry for that. In October 9-12th we will have a bigger event where more people can attend. The vibe on the event was amazing with lots of new faces, lots of information, and of course we had also just a wonderful time together...not to forget amazing food (thank you Dave and team). Also, a special thank you for FreeFlow event team, who made it all happen !!!

It was the very first FreeFlow event, along with ThreeFold talks, there were also super interesting sessions about Solidaridad, 5G (Kleos), a global education program (Koen), organic farming in Costa Rica (Jennifer), … Thank you to everyone for attending and contributing to this event.

A lot of people requested access to the information and content we shared at the event. We are still processing all that information and sorting the content but we will publish and share this asap.

**ThreeFold is focused and works with circles**

Threefold has a very focussed role which is promoting a new neutral fully decentralized internet and the technology which is needed to make this possible. ThreeFold is a decentralized movement where multiple organizations play a role:

*   **ThreeFold Tech** = software tech company, “self driving IT” (new [presentation](http://intro.threefold.tech)):  Chris and Kristof
*   **ThreeFold Tokens** = Adnan is responsible for promoting the TFT’s (tokens). Mazraa (one of the first ThreeFold farmers) is funding this effort for now, until TF Foundation will have funds.
*   **ThreeFold Grid** = Andreas owns the promotion of the grid (IT capacity of this new internet),  \
TFTech finances the TFGrid promotion. TFTech gets 10% revenue out of certified capacity.
*   **ThreeFold Foundation** = no funding today, in future revenue will come from the TF Grid and then the Foundation will be our independent vehicle with 60 + 30 guardians, protecting the interests of the neutral decentralized TFT & TFGrid.
*   **ThreeFold Ambassadors**: 100% volunteer driven organization, Owen & Gregor own the working of our ThreeFold Ambassadors and the ThreeFold Cafe is their main channel of communication.
*   **ThreeFold Love:** doing good project, Olivia & Nisha (100% volunteers)
*   **ThreeFold Farmers:** GreenEdgeCloud, Mazraa, BetterToken, … many more ...

Each of these projects have their own owners & separate teams, it's not more than logical that a “decentralized internet” needs a “decentralized organization”

**Announcement of the “FreeFlow Organization” :**

FreeFlow is an organization operating from Ibiza. Isabelle, Amparo, Dave, David, Sam, Romina are the driving force behind this organization.

FreeFlow wants to promote ideas for a more sustainable world. Freeflow believes that we as humans need to find our internal power and use this power to create a better world. Freeflow is operating a co-working and event space in Ibiza. FreeFlow organizes events around these ideas in multiple locations but Ibiza and Egypt are the starting locations. FreeFlow will be building out its own marketing and community to promote these values and ideas. FreeFlow is a not for profit project.

For more information about the freeflow values and ideas see: [http://www.freeflownation.org](http://www.freeflownation.org)

Of course as ThreeFold we 100% support this idea of decentralization and we are providing the digital backbone for it. ThreeFold is part of these events and is happy that the FreeFlow team wants to help us to grow our community and organize the events. This way also the costs are shared over multiple like minded projects and the events can grow faster to bring more people together to help ThreeFold to find a bigger audience.

**Announcement of FreeFlow Pages:**

We have been talking about FreeFlow Pages for a while now, we are happy to announce that FreeFlow Pages is ready to be used by a larger community.

The FreeFlow Pages are very much like a private Facebook, that is running on our TF Grid and is integrated with our brand new 100% decentralized 3bot mobile app.

From now on we will be using the FreeFlow Pages to promote all our activities and progress made. With the volume of news and rate of progress, it is very apparent that broadcasting on channels such as telegram was no longer efficient and can even be counterproductive.

What is really good about FreeFlow Pages is that it allows you to be very specific in which information you want to follow. Telegram will only be used to notify important information as published on FreeFlow Pages.

FreeFlow Pages is a new app and although the team has been working hard on stabilizing and simplifying FFP, there are for sure bugs, so please let us know if you found an issue.

FreeFlow Pages can be found on [http://freeflowpages.com](http://freeflowpages.com/) (please register and use our 3bot mobile app)

In September this year, every ThreeFold Grid user will be able to launch their own version of FreeFlow pages for their own communities, this will be a good use case of the ThreeFold Grid.

Some good starting points on FreeFlow Pages:

*   News about ThreeFold Tokens: [https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-tokens/](https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-tokens/)
*   Usage of TF grid: [https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-grid-users/](https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-grid-users/)   \
follow announcements on what’s happening with the grid.
*   ThreeFold Tech space: [https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-tech/](https://freeflowpages.com/s/tf-tech/),  \
news about the technology and our fundraising round.
*   And much more: just go to the index to see more: [FreeFlow Pages index](https://freeflowpages.com/directory/spaces)

**ThreeFold Support Center**

We are also launching our new ThreeFold Support Centre. Please go to [http://support.grid.tf](http://support.grid.tf/)

This support center is a tool used by the multiple organizations mentioned above and they will help you with your specific support requests. You can use it to ask questions, report bugs or just ask support.

This tool is also integrated with the new 3bot mobile app.

Please select the right support topic when creating a support request, will make it easier for us to define who needs to help you.

**Information coming soon**

There is lots more Information available than what we mentioned above e.g about our TFT liquidity program, grid launch, roadmap for TFTech…

The respective project owners are going to send the information around on our FreeFlow Pages

*   TFToken update 	: Adnan   (this week)
*   TFGrid update		: Andreas
*   TFTech update	: Chris
*   FreeFlow May Event	: Stela and Sam (presentations used & some video’s, need more time)

From now on, the respective owners above will ensure all relevant information is shared on FreeFlow Pages. Please join us on FreeFlow Pages as this will be our main channel for communications with our respective communities going forward.

**FAQ**

**Does this mean we will not use Facebook or other social media any longer?**

We believe Facebook and Instagram and tools like it are very good to make publicity about something. But we should only use that when the time is right, which will be very soon. Right now we are growing our community and it's our aim to keep the community informed and happy. Of course we will use it to make publicity about the ThreeFold Grid or the ThreeFold Tokens.

**We are impatient, we want to see the TFT to be liquid. When will it happen?**

Adnan has a lot of updates for you, we are executing our plan and this is going well.

We are completely in line with our previous updates, please follow that session from Adnan.

**We are a farmer, when will the grid be commercially active?**

As mentioned in our previous updates, the grid is now in beta mode for technical early adopters. We are also here executing our plan. There is a full-blown update being prepared by Andreas which will be available soon.

**Will we still use Telegram?**

There were lots of complaints in the past about the spammy nature of Telegram and the not organized manner of distributing information, this is why we brought the FreeFlow Pages live and we hope this will make it easier for you to decide which information streams you want to follow. There are a lot of projects in our community and this is only growing, we need a better mechanism.

Some channels will be kept online in Telegram to announce information being posted on FreeFlow Pages.

**Why all these projects? I am only interested in ThreeFold.**

Of course we love you to be interested in Threefold (-: Over the last year our ecosystem grew a lot and it's one of the nicest things happening but as a consequence, it became more difficult to follow what’s going on. \
This is the reason why we are happy about FreeFlow (Pages) and how this will help us to organize better . Each project owner is 100% focussed on their project. FreeFlow’s goal is to give the different projects a space to communicate and organize events where the larger community can come together to share the excitement. Of course, we all share a common vision which is love for each other and the world (-:

**Conclusion**

Personally, I am super excited with the amazing progress made, like any project things go not always 100% following the plan, but if we compare us with the state we were in 1 year ago, progress is incredible. At the end we all want the project to become more valuable as it was and more strong (reliable), I believe this absolutely happened, I am sure you will agree when you hear/see the updates from the respective project owners.

See you all on FreeFlow Pages.

Kristof
