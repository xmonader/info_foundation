**Welcome to the ThreeFold Foundation Wiki!**

This Wiki is a gathering of most of our created content in regards to the ThreeFold Foundation.
It features the way we work together, our definitions, our tools, presentations and much more for you to read and learn about.
Collaboration is one of our core values and we would love for you to contribute to make our mission a reality. Please visit the [How to contribute](https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/info_foundation/#/collaboration/contributing_in_agile_org) section for instructions.

On the left you will find the menu and index to quickly navigate through our documents.
